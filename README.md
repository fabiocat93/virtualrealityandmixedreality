Crossing road is an educational experience made for OculusGo that aims to teach children to cross safely the road.
The application is made-up of 4 levels and at the end the child will be rewarded with the “good pedestrian certificate”.
Levels have all the same structure:
	At the beginning the user is in a hub and he has in front three portals representing three crossing situations; the user, following the audio instructions will have to choose the right portal which depicts the correct scenario where perform the crossing.
	After this the user is teleported in the city street where he will have to perform the crossing according to what he chose in the portal choice.
	Once the crossing is concluded the user will be teleported again in the hub and he will be asked  to accomplish the next level.
The user interaction is driven by the Oculus controller: the user shall press the “trigger button” to select an option (in the hub) and keep it pressed during the walking (in the street). 
Moreover he’s not allowed to interact with the controller during  the audio instructions.

The player can fail in two situations:
	In the hub when he choose a wrong portal
	In the city street when he crosses the road without following the street rules explained.
Every time the user performs a bad choice he will be asked to re-perform that.
In addition during crossing the user can fail as many times as he do not follow the instructions.

Every level represents a different crossing scenario:
 	Level1:
		Hub: the user shall select the portal which shows the green traffic light
		Street: the user shall cross the road before the traffic light becomes red
	Level2:
		Hub: the user shall select the portal which shows the green traffic light
		Street: the user shall cross the road before the traffic light becomes red and he’s to be careful and avoid Police cars 
	Level3:
		Hub: the user shall select the portal which shows the crossing strips
		Street: the user shall cross the road avoiding cars 
	Level4:
 		Hub: the user can select each one of the three portals. Each one has a music associated that will be played also in the street
		Street: the user shall wait for the music to be finished and cross the road avoiding cars
